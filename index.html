## Local PDF Document Notifications

### Purpose of Notifications
We use local notifications to alert users when a new PDF document has been downloaded and is available for access within our app. When a user taps on the notification, it will open the PDF document for them.

### Information Collected
We do not collect any personal information or data from users through the local PDF document notifications. The notifications are triggered and handled entirely on the user's device.

### Notification Content
The local notifications will contain the following information:
- Title: "File downloaded"
- Body: "Tap to open PDF."

### User Controls
Users can manage their preferences for receiving local PDF document notifications through their device's system-level notification settings. Users can choose to enable or disable these notifications at any time.

### Data Storage
No notification-related data is stored by our app. The local notifications are handled entirely on the user's device without any data being transmitted to our servers or stored by our app.

### Third-Party Services
We do not use any third-party services for the delivery of these local PDF document notifications. All notification handling is done natively within the app.
