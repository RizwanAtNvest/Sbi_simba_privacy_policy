  <h2>Local PDF Document Notifications</h2>

  <h3>Purpose of Notifications</h3>
  <p>We use local notifications to alert users when a new PDF document has been downloaded and is available for access within our app. When a user taps on the notification, it will open the PDF document for them.</p>

  <h3>Information Collected</h3>
  <p>We do not collect any personal information or data from users through the local PDF document notifications. The notifications are triggered and handled entirely on the user's device.</p>

  <h3>Notification Content</h3>
  <p>The local notifications will contain the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Title: "File downloaded"</li>
    <li>Body: "Tap to open PDF."</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>User Controls</h3>
  <p>Users can manage their preferences for receiving local PDF document notifications through their device's system-level notification settings. Users can choose to enable or disable these notifications at any time.</p>

  <h3>Data Storage</h3>
  <p>No notification-related data is stored by our app. The local notifications are handled entirely on the user's device without any data being transmitted to our servers or stored by our app.</p>

  <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
  <p>We do not use any third-party services for the delivery of these local PDF document notifications. All notification handling is done natively within the app.</p>
